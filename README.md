# Hydroneer 2.0+ Template

This template was created, and is maintained, by the Hydroneer Modding Community for the Hydroneer Modding Community.

We are currently using Unreal Engine version 4.26. 

If you would like to contribute items see below.



## To Make Mods:

In most cases you can use the lighter Master branch template. It contains the project files and folders needed to get started, but does not contain the Textures, Materials, or Meshes that increase size on disk and project loading times. If you only need a small number of these items it is best to extract them on an as needed basis.

### New for 2.0:
A beautiful, complete, painstakingly wired together by modder F4t4l, version of the template can be found in the fullTemplat branch. This one is much larger on disk, but includes *everything*, in color. If you're working with a large number of existing meshes or textures this one is essential.

## To Contribute Items / Help with the Template:

You will want to grab the development branch. Here you may find objects using generic/empty objects that still need to be completed. How to do this is beyond the scope of this readme file, but if you are able, changes you make can then be added to a push request for the development branch. Once verified they will be added to the other branches as needed.

Many of these assets are initially created by a prefix based script. This can cause type errors when retail file names do not match types. The script works around most of these cases, but it is something to be aware of when going through the incomplete assets. Also take special note of any FIXME_ prefix as these are almost definitely incorrect types.
