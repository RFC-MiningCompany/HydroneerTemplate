## Reference Content Folder

This Content folder is generated by the Populate.py script. It contains the directory tree and blank asset files with, mostly, correct names.

Variables, parents, functions, events and the like must be entered manually in the editor.

Texture, Mesh, and Material references are not included here.

FIXME_ files are down to mainly those with improper names in the retail assets (Thanks Resa). If you find a large number (5+) sharing a common prefix, and know how to create the dummy object, contact Cheebsta on Discord.
