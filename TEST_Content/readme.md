FIRST DRAFT!!!

Help Wanted: FIXME_ Files mean I did not know how to create that type. With a proper dummy file these can be generated as well.

Parent Links and functions still need to be created manually at this point.

Update 3/27:
Dropped Textures folder from generation as the blank objects are not useful (Drop meshes too?)
Added more dummy objects to generation, down to about 5% coming out without proper object
Fixed some of the base objects (Game Controller, Instance)
